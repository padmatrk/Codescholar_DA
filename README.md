DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON NATIONAL WORKSHOP
Hi I attended 1-Week National Workshop on "Data Analytics With Python" from 21-26 June 2021, conducted by THE CODE SCHOLAR.


I got to have hands on experience on:

Python
Maths Operations
Data Massaging and Cleaning
Machine Learning
Visualization Techniques
Project Understanding

During this 1-Week, everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Nitesh.
Speakers from different industry domains, lightened up the session with their experience. I got to learn a lot during this 1-Week and it was an amazing experience learning with THE CODE SCHOLAR.
